Heavenly peace, divinest comfort, Here by faith in Him to dwell; For I know whate'er befall me, Jesus doeth all things well; For I know whate'er be fall me, Jesus doeth all things well."

All the way my Saviour leads me; Cheers each winding path I tread; Gives me grace for every trial, Feeds me with the living bread; Though my weary steps may falter, And my soul athirst may be, Gushing from the Rock before me, Lo, a spring of joy I see; Gushing from the Rock before me, Lo, a spring of joy I see."

Perfect rest to me is promised In my Father's house above; When I wake to life immortal, Wing my flight to realms of day, This my song through endless ages, Jesus led me all the way; This my song through endless ages, Jesus led me all the way."
